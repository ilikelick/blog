To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. All of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams comes from a local dairy and as for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to your scoop.

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is just as important as what does. We never use artificial colors or  flavors, high fructose corn syrup or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

&nbsp;

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be!  We are also committed to using only compostable cups, spoons and napkins.  We churn every batch, roll each waffle cone made from our homemade recipe and pack each pint by hand in our shop to serve up the most honest ice creams we can.

&nbsp;

We hope you will enjoy them!",

The Story Behind The Best Ice Cream in Austin, Texas

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.  

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also be good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.
 
As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

We opened Lick Honest Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities, enjoying homemade ice cream: Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.
<br/>
In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Honest Ice Creams.",

Meet Anthony and Chad, the Brains Behind the Local Austin Shop

Anthony Sobotik and Chad Palmatier opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because they wanted to provide what Lick enthusiasts have come to recognize as “honest ice creams.” The two each grew up in small, rural communities, and Chad spent much of his youth enjoying local Texas homemade ice cream. 

The pair met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed, and after many visits to Chad’s hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what Chad grew up with...small town ice cream shops serving up seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients. Fresh, unique and delicious! Chad had never eaten ice cream at a chain — and from 2005 on, Anthony vowed her never would again.  

Flash forward, and Anthony, who had moved to NYC hoping to write for a food magazine, was working as a caterer and event planner for a prestigious company. When Chad’s career took them away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan out to the Midwest, he and Anthony began to mull over the possibility of opening their own ice cream shop. The more flavors they tasted and the more recipes they concocted, the more the notion began to show promise.

All the while, Chad was falling in love with Austin, Texas more on each trip to visit Anthony’s friends and family. In time, the right moment came for them to sell their Midwestern home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick, bringing local, honest ice creams to town for all to enjoy. ",

        "post_content": "Meet Anthony and Chad, the Brains Behind the Local Austin Shop

Anthony Sobotik and Chad Palmatier opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because they wanted to provide what Lick enthusiasts have come to recognize as “honest ice creams.” The two each grew up in small, rural communities, and Chad spent much of his youth enjoying local Texas homemade ice cream. 

The pair met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed, and after many visits to Chad’s hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what Chad grew up with...small town ice cream shops serving up seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients. Fresh, unique and delicious! Chad had never eaten ice cream at a chain — and from 2005 on, Anthony vowed her never would again.  

Flash forward, and Anthony, who had moved to NYC hoping to write for a food magazine, was working as a caterer and event planner for a prestigious company. When Chad’s career took them away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan out to the Midwest, he and Anthony began to mull over the possibility of opening their own ice cream shop. The more flavors they tasted and the more recipes they concocted, the more the notion began to show promise.

All the while, Chad was falling in love with Austin, Texas more on each trip to visit Anthony’s friends and family. In time, the right moment came for them to sell their Midwestern home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick, bringing local, honest ice creams to town for all to enjoy. ",

All of our ice creams are made with 100% milk and cream from <a href=\"http://www.mill-kingmarket.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery</a>, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

&nbsp;

The herd consists of handpicked Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When necessary, they supplement with grain that is non-GMO, corn and soy free. The delicious milk and cream produced is always non-homogenized and low temperature pasteurized.  This essentially means any harmful bacteria is eliminated while all of the beneficial enzymes stay in tact. All of these components make for very healthy and very delicious milk and cream. This is the stuff our grandparents drank and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams.

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.

        "post_content": "<h2>The Story Behind The Best Ice Cream in Austin, Texas</h2>

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.  

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also be good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.
 
As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

<h2>The Story Behind The Best Ice Cream in Austin, Texas</h2>

<img style=\"padding: 0 0 10px 20px;\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lick-store-front.jpg\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" width=\"350\" height=\"208\" align=\"right\" />

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.  

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also be good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.
 
As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

<h2>The Story Behind The Best Ice Cream in Austin, Texas</h2>

<img style=\"padding: 0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lick-store-front.jpg\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" width=\"350\" height=\"208\" align=\"right\" />

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.  

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also be good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.
 
As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

<h2>Meet Anthony and Chad, the Brains Behind the Local Austin Shop</h2>

Anthony Sobotik and Chad Palmatier opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because they wanted to provide what Lick enthusiasts have come to recognize as “honest ice creams.” The two each grew up in small, rural communities, and Chad spent much of his youth enjoying local Texas homemade ice cream. 

The pair met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed, and after many visits to Chad’s hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what Chad grew up with...small town ice cream shops serving up seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients. Fresh, unique and delicious! Chad had never eaten ice cream at a chain — and from 2005 on, Anthony vowed her never would again.  

Flash forward, and Anthony, who had moved to NYC hoping to write for a food magazine, was working as a caterer and event planner for a prestigious company. When Chad’s career took them away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan out to the Midwest, he and Anthony began to mull over the possibility of opening their own ice cream shop. The more flavors they tasted and the more recipes they concocted, the more the notion began to show promise.

All the while, Chad was falling in love with Austin, Texas more on each trip to visit Anthony’s friends and family. In time, the right moment came for them to sell their Midwestern home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick, bringing local, honest ice creams to town for all to enjoy. ",

<h2>The Story Behind The Best Ice Cream in Austin, Texas</h2>

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.  

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also be good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.
 
As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

<h2>Honesty is the Best Policy, Even When it Comes to Ice Cream</h2>
<img style=\"padding: 10px 0 15px 20px;\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lick-store-front.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" align=\"right\" />

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. All of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams comes from a local dairy and as for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to your scoop.

&nbsp;

<img style=\"padding: 10px 0 15px 20px;\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lick-honest-ice-creams.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" align=\"right\" />

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is just as important as what does. We never use artificial colors or  flavors, high fructose corn syrup or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

&nbsp;

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be!  We are also committed to using only compostable cups, spoons and napkins.  We churn every batch, roll each waffle cone made from our homemade recipe and pack each pint by hand in our shop to serve up the most honest ice creams we can.

&nbsp;

We hope you will enjoy them!",

<h2>The Story Behind The Best Ice Cream in Austin, Texas</h2>

<img style=\"padding: 0 0 10px 20px;\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lick-store-front.jpg\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" width=\"350\" height=\"208\" align=\"right\" />

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.  

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also be good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.
 
As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

        "post_content": "<h2>Meet Anthony and Chad, the Brains Behind the Local Austin Shop</h2>

Anthony Sobotik and Chad Palmatier opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because they wanted to provide what Lick enthusiasts have come to recognize as “honest ice creams.” The two each grew up in small, rural communities, and Chad spent much of his youth enjoying local Texas homemade ice cream. 

The pair met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed, and after many visits to Chad’s hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what Chad grew up with...small town ice cream shops serving up seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients. Fresh, unique and delicious! Chad had never eaten ice cream at a chain — and from 2005 on, Anthony vowed her never would again.  

Flash forward, and Anthony, who had moved to NYC hoping to write for a food magazine, was working as a caterer and event planner for a prestigious company. When Chad’s career took them away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan out to the Midwest, he and Anthony began to mull over the possibility of opening their own ice cream shop. The more flavors they tasted and the more recipes they concocted, the more the notion began to show promise.

All the while, Chad was falling in love with Austin, Texas more on each trip to visit Anthony’s friends and family. In time, the right moment came for them to sell their Midwestern home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick, bringing local, honest ice creams to town for all to enjoy. ",

All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from Mill-King Market & Creamery, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco.

They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces. 

The herd consists of Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When supplemental feed is used, it is free of any GMOs.  The delicious milk and cream produced is always low-temperature pasteurized and non-homogenized. All of these components make for the most delicious milk and cream we’ve ever tasted.

Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that collaborate with Lick. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer.  

We are also able to work with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bakers and bee keepers, who help enhance our ice creams with unique flavor profiles. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.",

<h2>Get Honest Answers About Honest Ice Creams</h2>
<h3>Is your ice cream organic?</h3>
No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use is certified organic; and, therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to get our ingredients from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!
<h3>Are your products gluten-free?</h3>
Yes. Our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.
<h3>Are your waffle cones homemade?</h3>
Yes. We make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand in our shops. Our cones contain local organic eggs and are NOT gluten-free.
<h3>Where do you make your ice cream?</h3>
We make every single batch by hand at our production kitchen in Northwest Austin.  Each flavor is created in 2½ gallon batches and either sent by the tub to our Austin and San Antonio shops or packed by hand into pint containers and distributed to our many wholesale customers all over the state of Texas.
<h3>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</h3>
Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible.

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.  

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also be good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.
 
As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be!

<h2>Meet Anthony and Chad, the Brains Behind the Local Austin Shop</h2>

Anthony Sobotik and Chad Palmatier opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because they wanted to provide what Lick enthusiasts have come to recognize as “honest ice creams.” The two each grew up in small, rural communities, and Chad spent much of his youth enjoying local Texas homemade ice cream. 

The pair met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed, and after many visits to Chad’s hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what Chad grew up with...small town ice cream shops serving up seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients. Fresh, unique and delicious! Chad had never eaten ice cream at a chain — and from 2005 on, Anthony vowed her never would again.  

Flash forward, and Anthony, who had moved to NYC hoping to write for a food magazine, was working as a caterer and event planner for a prestigious company. When Chad’s career took them away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan out to the Midwest, he and Anthony began to mull over the possibility of opening their own ice cream shop. The more flavors they tasted and the more recipes they concocted, the more the notion began to show promise.

All the while, Chad was falling in love with Austin, Texas more on each trip to visit Anthony’s friends and family. In time, the right moment came for them to sell their Midwestern home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick, bringing local, honest ice creams to town for all to enjoy. ",

<h2>Meet Us (Anthony and Chad). We Love Ice Cream!</h2>

We opened Lick Honest Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities, enjoying homemade ice cream: Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.


In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Honest Ice Creams.",

<h2><b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.3131228587590158\">Get Honest Answers About Honest Ice Creams</b></h2>
<h3>Is your ice cream organic?</h3>
<em>No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use is certified organic, and therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “Organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to do so from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!</em>

<h3>Are your products gluten-free?</h3>
<em>Yes . Our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<h3>Are your waffle cones homemade?</h3>
<em>Yes . We make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand here in our South Austin shop. Our cones contain eggs and are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<h3>Where do you make your ice cream?</h3>
<em>We make every single batch here at our shop on South Lamar in Austin. Each flavor is created in 21/2 gallon batches and either sent to the dipping cabinet or packed by hand into a pint container.</em>

<h3>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</h3>
<em>Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible. </em>

<h2><b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.3131228587590158\">Get Honest Answers About Honest Ice Creams</b></h2>
<strong>Is your ice cream organic?</strong>
<em>No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use certified organic, and therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “Organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to source from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!</em>

<strong>Are your products gluten-free?</strong>
<em>Yes — our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<strong>Are your waffle cones homemade?</strong>
<em>Yes — we make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand here in our South Austin shop. Our cones contain eggs and are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<strong>Where do you make your ice cream?</strong>
<em>We make every single batch here at our shop on South Lamar in Austin. Each flavor is created in 21/2 gallon batches and either sent to the dipping cabinet or packed by hand into a pint container.</em>

<strong>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</strong>
<em>Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible. </em>",

<h2>The Story Behind The Best Ice Cream in Austin, Texas</h2>

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces. 

The herd consists of Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When supplemental feed is used, it is free of any GMOs.  The delicious milk and cream produced is always low-temperature pasteurized and non-homogenized. All of these components make for the most delicious milk and cream we’ve ever tasted. This is milk and cream like our grandparents drank, and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

We are also able to work with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bakers and bee keepers, who help enhance our ice creams with unique flavor profiles. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.",

<h2>Where Austin's Best Ice Cream Gets its Start</h2>
All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

The herd consists of Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When supplemental feed is used, it is free of any GMOs. The delicious milk and cream produced is always low-temperature pasteurized and non-homogenized. All of these components make for the most delicious milk and cream we’ve ever tasted. This is milk and cream like our grandparents drank, and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

<h2>We Couldn't and Wouldn't do it Without Them!</h2>
Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer us and when the season is right for each ingredient.

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.

<h3>Is your ice cream organic?</h3>
<em>No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use is certified organic; and, therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “Organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to do so from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!</em>
<h3>Are your products gluten-free?</h3>
<em>Yes . Our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.</em>
<h3>Are your waffle cones homemade?</h3>
<em>Yes . We make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand here in our South Austin shop. Our cones contain eggs and are NOT gluten-free.</em>
<h3>Where do you make your ice cream?</h3>
<em>We make every single batch here at our shop on South Lamar in Austin. Each flavor is created in 21/2 gallon batches and either sent to the dipping cabinet or packed by hand into a pint container.</em>
<h3>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</h3>
<em>Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible. </em>

<h2>Honesty is the best policy, even when it comes to ice cream.<img style=\"padding: 0 0 10px 20px;\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lick-store-front.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"208\" align=\"right\" /></h2>
To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

<h2>Meet Anthony and Chad, the Brains Behind the Local Austin Shop</h2>
Anthony Sobotik and Chad Palmatier opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because they wanted to provide what Lick enthusiasts have come to recognize as “honest ice creams.” The two each grew up in small, rural communities, and Chad spent much of his youth enjoying local Texas homemade ice cream.

The pair met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed, and after many visits to Chad’s hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what Chad grew up with...small town ice cream shops serving up seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients. Fresh, unique and delicious! Chad had never eaten ice cream at a chain — and from 2005 on, Anthony vowed her never would again.

Flash forward, and Anthony, who had moved to NYC hoping to write for a food magazine, was working as a caterer and event planner for a prestigious company. When Chad’s career took them away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan out to the Midwest, he and Anthony began to mull over the possibility of opening their own ice cream shop. The more flavors they tasted and the more recipes they concocted, the more the notion began to show promise.

All the while, Chad was falling in love with Austin, Texas more on each trip to visit Anthony’s friends and family. In time, the right moment came for them to sell their Midwestern home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick, bringing local, honest ice creams to town for all to enjoy.",

<h2>Where Austin's Best Ice Cream Gets its Start</h2>
All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

The herd consists of Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When supplemental feed is used, it is free of any GMOs. The delicious milk and cream produced is always low-temperature pasteurized and non-homogenized. All of these components make for the most delicious milk and cream we’ve ever tasted. This is milk and cream like our grandparents drank, and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

<h2>Honesty is the Best Policy, Even When it Comes to Ice Cream.<img style=\"padding: 0 0 10px 20px;\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lick-store-front.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"208\" align=\"right\" /></h2>
To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

<h2>Meet Us (Anthony and Chad). We Love Ice Cream!</h2>
We opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities enjoying homemade ice cream, Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.

In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Ice Creams.",

<h2>We start with the best!</h2>
All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

The herd consists of handpicked Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When necessary, they supplement with grain that is non-GMO, corn and soy free. The delicious milk and cream produced is always non-homogenized and low temperature pasteurized.  This essentially means any harmful bacteria is eliminated while all of the beneficial enzymes stay in tact. All of these components make for very healthy and very delicious milk and cream. This is the stuff our grandparents drank and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that we get to work with.

<strong>Is your ice cream organic?</strong>
<em>No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use is certified organic, and therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “Organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to do so from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!</em>

<strong>Are your products gluten-free?</strong>
<em>Yes . Our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<strong>Are your waffle cones homemade?</strong>
<em>Yes . We make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand here in our South Austin shop. Our cones contain eggs and are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<strong>Where do you make your ice cream?</strong>
<em>We make every single batch here at our shop on South Lamar in Austin. Each flavor is created in 21/2 gallon batches and either sent to the dipping cabinet or packed by hand into a pint container.</em>

<strong>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</strong>
<em>Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible. </em>

<h2><b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.3131228587590158\">Get Honest Answers About Honest Ice Creams</b></h2>
<h3>Is your ice cream organic?</h3>
<em>No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use is certified organic, and therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “Organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to do so from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!</em>

<h3>Are your products gluten-free?</h3>
<em>Yes . Our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<h3>Are your waffle cones homemade?</h3>
<em>Yes . We make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand here in our South Austin shop. Our cones contain eggs and are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<h3>Where do you make your ice cream?</h3>
<em>We make every single batch here at our shop on South Lamar in Austin. Each flavor is created in 21/2 gallon batches and either sent to the dipping cabinet or packed by hand into a pint container.</em>

<h3>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</h3>
<em>Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible. </em>

<h2>Honesty is the Best Policy, Even When it Comes to Ice Cream<img style=\"padding: 0 0 10px 20px;\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lick-store-front.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"208\" align=\"right\" /></h2>
To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

<h3>Is your ice cream organic?</h3>
<em>No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use is certified organic, and therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “Organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to do so from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!</em>

<h3>Are your products gluten-free?</h3>
<em>Yes . Our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<h3>Are your waffle cones homemade?</h3>
<em>Yes . We make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand here in our South Austin shop. Our cones contain eggs and are NOT gluten-free.</em>

<h3>Where do you make your ice cream?</h3>
<em>We make every single batch here at our shop on South Lamar in Austin. Each flavor is created in 21/2 gallon batches and either sent to the dipping cabinet or packed by hand into a pint container.</em>

<h3>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</h3>
<em>Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible. </em>

<h2>Meet Us (Anthony and Chad). We Love Ice Cream!</h2>
We opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities, enjoying homemade ice cream: Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.

In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Ice Creams.",

<h2>We Couldn't and Wouldn't do it Without Them!</h2>
Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer us and when the season is right for each ingredient.

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.",

<h2>We Start with the Best in Texas!</h2>
All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

The herd consists of handpicked Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When necessary, they supplement with grain that is non-GMO, corn and soy free. The delicious milk and cream produced is always non-homogenized and low temperature pasteurized.  This essentially means any harmful bacteria is eliminated while all of the beneficial enzymes stay in tact. All of these components make for very healthy and very delicious milk and cream. This is the stuff our grandparents drank and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.

&nbsp;

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

&nbsp;

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.

We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas.

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.</p>

All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

The herd consists of handpicked Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When necessary, they supplement with grain that is non-GMO, corn and soy free. The delicious milk and cream produced is always non-homogenized and low temperature pasteurized.  This essentially means any harmful bacteria is eliminated while all of the beneficial enzymes stay in tact. All of these components make for very healthy and very delicious milk and cream. This is the stuff our grandparents drank and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

<h2>Meet Us (Anthony and Chad). We Love Ice Cream!</h2>
<img style=\"padding: 10px 0 15px 20px;\" alt=\"Meet the Lick Ice Cream founders!\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lick-us.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" align=\"right\" />

We opened Lick Honest Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities, enjoying homemade ice cream: Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.
<br/>
In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Ice Creams.",

<h2>Honesty is the Best Policy, Even When it Comes to Ice Cream</h2>
<img style=\"padding: 10px 0 15px 20px;\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lick-store-front.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" align=\"right\" />

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. All of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams comes from a local dairy and as for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to your scoop.

&nbsp;

<img style=\"padding: 10px 0 15px 20px;\" alt=\"Honest Ice Creams\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lick-honest-ice-creams.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" align=\"right\" />

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is just as important as what does. We never use artificial colors or  flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

&nbsp;

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be!  We are also committed to using only compostable cups, spoons and napkins.  We churn every batch, roll each waffle cone made from our homemade recipe and pack each pint by hand in our shop to serve up the most honest ice creams we can.

&nbsp;

We hope you will enjoy them!",

<h2>Meet Us (Anthony and Chad). We Love Ice Cream!</h2>
We opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities, enjoying homemade ice cream: Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.

&nbsp;

In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Ice Creams.",

<h2>We Couldn't and Wouldn't do it Without Them!</h2>
Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer us and when the season is right for each ingredient.

&nbsp;

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.",

<h2>Meet Us (Anthony and Chad). We Love Ice Cream!</h2>
We opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities, enjoying homemade ice cream: Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.

In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Ice Creams.",

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.

As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from.

All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

The herd consists of handpicked Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When necessary, they supplement with grain that is non-GMO, corn and soy free. The delicious milk and cream produced is always non-homogenized and low temperature pasteurized.  This essentially means any harmful bacteria is eliminated while all of the beneficial enzymes stay in tact. All of these components make for very healthy and very delicious milk and cream. This is the stuff our grandparents drank and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

<h2>We Start with the Best in Texas!</h2>
<img style=\"padding: 10px 0 15px 20px;\" alt=\"Lick's Dairy\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lick-our-dairy.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" align=\"right\" />

All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from <a href=\"http://www.mill-kingmarket.com/Mill-King_Market.html\">Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery</a>, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

The herd consists of handpicked Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When necessary, they supplement with grain that is non-GMO, corn and soy free. The delicious milk and cream produced is always non-homogenized and low temperature pasteurized.  This essentially means any harmful bacteria is eliminated while all of the beneficial enzymes stay in tact. All of these components make for very healthy and very delicious milk and cream. This is the stuff our grandparents drank and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

        "post_content": "To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.",

To us, honest ice creams simply means we use only pure, whole ingredients. Most importantly, all of the milk and cream used to make our ice creams come from a local dairy. As for everything else, we know where every ingredient originates. We know each of the farmers and food artisans we source from. We adore our local farmers, visiting them frequently to personally pick up fresh ingredients weekly from their farms or market stands. Watching the cows graze at their leisure in the beautiful Central Texas pastures never fails to bring smiles to our faces. As small local business owners, we have the pleasure of witnessing our milk and cream as it journeys from the cow to our scoop, and finally, to your taste buds. We make every batch and pack each pint by hand in our shop to deliver the premium ice cream our customers love.
&nbsp;

What doesn’t go into our ice creams is nearly as important as what does. We never use artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, stabilizers or preservatives...ever! Ice cream shouldn’t just taste good — we believe it should also<em> be</em> good. Unique ice cream flavors that come from only the finest ingredients (and nothing else) is what we’re all about.
&nbsp;
As a sustainable business, Lick takes a cue from the ever-wise Mother Nature. Many of our flavors are inspired by and created with the seasonal offerings from the fertile land in and around Austin, Texas. This provides variety throughout the year and guarantees a product that is always as fresh as can be! Here at Lick, we’re proud to offer our friends and neighbors the very best ice cream Austin has to offer.",

<h2>We Couldn't and Wouldn't do it Without Them!</h2>
Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer us and when the season is right for each ingredient.

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.

All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from <a href=\"http://www.mill-kingmarket.com/Mill-King_Market.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery</a>, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

The herd consists of handpicked Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When necessary, they supplement with grain that is non-GMO, corn and soy free. The delicious milk and cream produced is always non-homogenized and low temperature pasteurized.  This essentially means any harmful bacteria is eliminated while all of the beneficial enzymes stay in tact. All of these components make for very healthy and very delicious milk and cream. This is the stuff our grandparents drank and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

<h1>Lemon Berry</h1>
Our newest dairy-free option is bright and refreshing!

Sweet strawberries from New Braunfels, Texas are blended with the juice of organic Meyer Lemons  from G&amp;S Groves in the Rio Grande Valley.  To finish if off, we add a touch of vanilla and some Round Rock Honey.",

<h2>Meet Us (Anthony and Chad). We Love Ice Cream!</h2>
We opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities, enjoying homemade ice cream: Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.
&nbsp;
In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Ice Creams.",

All of our ice creams are made with milk and cream from <a href=\"http://www.mill-kingmarket.com/Mill-King_Market.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery</a>, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

&nbsp;

The herd consists of handpicked Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When necessary, they supplement with grain that is non-GMO, corn and soy free. The delicious milk and cream produced is always non-homogenized and low temperature pasteurized.  This essentially means any harmful bacteria is eliminated while all of the beneficial enzymes stay in tact. All of these components make for very healthy and very delicious milk and cream. This is the stuff our grandparents drank and it’s the reason we can make ice creams as honest as the ones they enjoyed.",

        "post_content": "<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>Get Honest Answers About Honest Ice Creams</h2>
<h3>Is your ice cream organic?</h3>
<em>No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use is certified organic; and, therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to get our ingredients from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!</em>
<h3>Are your products gluten-free?</h3>
<em>Yes. Our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.</em>
<h3>Are your waffle cones homemade?</h3>
<em>Yes. We make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand here in our South Austin shop. Our cones contain eggs and are NOT gluten-free.</em>
<h3>Where do you make your ice cream?</h3>
<em>We make every single batch here at our shop on South Lamar in Austin. Each flavor is created in 2½ gallon batches and either sent to the dipping cabinet or packed by hand into a pint container.</em>
<h3>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</h3>
<em>Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible. </em>

<h2>Meet Us (Anthony and Chad). We Love Ice Cream!</h2>
<img style=\"padding: 10px 0 15px 20px;\"  alt=\"Meet the Lick Ice Cream founders!\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lick-us.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" align=\"right\" />

We opened Lick Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities, enjoying homemade ice cream: Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.

In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Ice Creams.",

<h2>We Couldn't and Wouldn't do it Without Them!</h2>
Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer us and when the season is right for each ingredient.

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.

<h2>We Couldn't and Wouldn't do it Without Them!</h2>
Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer us and when the season is right for each ingredient.

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.

        "post_content": "<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>Get Honest Answers About Honest Ice Creams</h2>
<h3>Is your ice cream organic?</h3>
No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use is certified organic; and, therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to get our ingredients from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!
<h3>Are your products gluten-free?</h3>
Yes. Our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.
<h3>Are your waffle cones homemade?</h3>
Yes. We make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand here in our South Austin shop. Our cones contain eggs and are NOT gluten-free.
<h3>Where do you make your ice cream?</h3>
We make every single batch here at our shop on South Lamar in Austin. Each flavor is created in 2½ gallon batches and either sent to the dipping cabinet or packed by hand into a pint container.
<h3>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</h3>
Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible.

        "post_content": "There really is a Hazel and she’s my granny.  Each year for Thanksgiving she would make at least one pumpkin pie and she’d say it was just for me, usually by whispering it in my ear.  Maybe she didn’t want the other grandchildren to hear.  Whatever the reason, I LOVE her pumpkin pie.  I remember seeing them lined up with the other desserts on my grandparents’ bar and going out of my mind counting the minutes until it was time to dive in.  I’m a huge baked goods fanatic and even among all the other offerings my family members had crafted, my main objective was to get a piece of her pumpkin pie on my plate before it had been devoured by my cousins.

So what made Hazel’s pumpkin pie leave such an impression on me, even after all these years?  Sure, you could assume that it was just the fact that my Granny, one of the women who taught me to bake and a person I love with all my heart, made the cake and I would of course love it out of my sheer emotional connection to the baker.   That is not the case.  Her pies really focused on the pumpkin.  So many times a pumpkin pie is loaded up with spices that the subtle, fresh flavor of the pumpkin is lost and it ends up tasting like a cinnamon pie with a dash of clove, nutmeg and ginger.  Granny’s pies were simple and delicious.  There was a nice balance of nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  She went a bit heavier on the clove, which I love.  I also remember eating her pumpkin pie and not feeling the need to cover it in whipped cream, although I have to admit (and I say this knowing I may be a bit judged) that there were times that I added a hefty dollop of cool-whip.

&nbsp;

Today, we pay homage to this lovely, feisty, Texas lady with the flavor Hazel’s Pumpkin Pie.  We buy Texas pie pumpkins and roast them in the oven in our very own kitchen.  Once the seeds and flesh have been removed, pounds of it are blended into our ice cream base and enhanced with a little nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  We go a bit heavy on the clove.  What we get is the best pumpkin ice cream I’ve ever had that tastes like the most delicious, freshest pumpkin pie I’ve ever eaten.  Actually, if you’ve never had the pleasure of eating my Granny’s pumpkin pie, it’s probably better.

        "post_content": "There really is a Hazel and she’s my granny.  Each year for Thanksgiving she would make at least one pumpkin pie and she’d say it was just for me, usually by whispering it in my ear.  Maybe she didn’t want the other grandchildren to hear.  Whatever the reason, I LOVE her pumpkin pie.  I remember seeing them lined up with the other desserts on my grandparents’ bar and going out of my mind counting the minutes until it was time to dive in.  I’m a huge baked goods fanatic and even among all the other offerings my family members had crafted, my main objective was to get a piece of her pumpkin pie on my plate before it had been devoured by my cousins.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1703\" alt=\"3-grannyhazel\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3-grannyhazel.jpg\" width=\"440\" height=\"282\" data-id=\"1703\" />

So what made Hazel’s pumpkin pie leave such an impression on me, even after all these years?  Sure, you could assume that it was just the fact that my Granny, one of the women who taught me to bake and a person I love with all my heart, made the cake and I would of course love it out of my sheer emotional connection to the baker.   That is not the case.  Her pies really focused on the pumpkin.  So many times a pumpkin pie is loaded up with spices that the subtle, fresh flavor of the pumpkin is lost and it ends up tasting like a cinnamon pie with a dash of clove, nutmeg and ginger.  Granny’s pies were simple and delicious.  There was a nice balance of nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  She went a bit heavier on the clove, which I love.  I also remember eating her pumpkin pie and not feeling the need to cover it in whipped cream, although I have to admit (and I say this knowing I may be a bit judged) that there were times that I added a hefty dollop of cool-whip.

&nbsp;

Today, we pay homage to this lovely, feisty, Texas lady with the flavor Hazel’s Pumpkin Pie.  We buy Texas pie pumpkins and roast them in the oven in our very own kitchen.  Once the seeds and flesh have been removed, pounds of it are blended into our ice cream base and enhanced with a little nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  We go a bit heavy on the clove.  What we get is the best pumpkin ice cream I’ve ever had that tastes like the most delicious, freshest pumpkin pie I’ve ever eaten.  Actually, if you’ve never had the pleasure of eating my Granny’s pumpkin pie, it’s probably better.

<h2>Meet Us (Anthony and Chad). We Love Ice Cream!</h2>
<img style=\"padding: 10px 0 15px 20px;\" alt=\"Meet the Lick Ice Cream founders!\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lick-us.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" align=\"right\" />

We opened Lick Honest Ice Creams in the fall of 2011 because we wanted to offer what we call \"honest ice creams\" to savvy palates in Austin. We both grew up in small rural communities, enjoying homemade ice cream: Anthony from Hallettsville in South Central Texas and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We met in New York City in the winter of 2005 and immediately connected (small town minds in the big city). As the years passed and after many visits to my hometown, Anthony began to truly appreciate what I grew up with...local, small town ice cream shops that made seasonal flavors with locally sourced ingredients: fresh, unique and delicious! With each lick, Anthony wondered what kind of flavors he could craft from the ingredients he grew up eating in Texas. I never ate ice cream at a chain, and, from 2005 on, Anthony didn't either.

In New York, Anthony (who had actually moved to the city with hopes of being a writer for a food magazine) worked as a caterer and event planner, where he deepened his love of working with food. He became inspired by the menus he helped develop and the dishes once they were prepared, so he began mentally storing these for future use. Eventually, my career took us away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the Midwest. As several years passed, ice cream was eaten, recipes were written, and the dream of honest ice creams began dancing in our heads. All the while, with each trip to visit Anthony's family and friends, I was falling more and more in love with Austin and becoming inspired by its creative spirit and local flavors. Finally, the right time came to sell our home, move to Austin, and begin building Lick Ice Creams.",

<h2>We Couldn't and Wouldn't do it Without Them!</h2>
Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer us and when the season is right for each ingredient.

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.

<h2>We Couldn't and Wouldn't do it Without Them!</h2>
Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer us and when the season is right for each ingredient.

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.

All of our ice creams are made with 100% milk and cream from <a href=\"http://www.mill-kingmarket.com/Mill-King_Market.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mill-King Market &amp; Creamery</a>, located in McGregor, Texas, just outside of Waco. The Miller family has owned and operated this dairy for three generations. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and they truly care about the milk and cream their select herd of 100 cows produces.

The herd consists of handpicked Jersey, Brown Swiss and Holstein cows that are never given hormones or antibiotics and are primarily grass-fed. When necessary, they supplement with grain that is non-GMO, corn and soy free. The delicious milk and cream produced is always non-homogenized and low temperature pasteurized.  This essentially means any harmful bacteria is eliminated while all of the beneficial enzymes stay in tact. All of these components make for very healthy and very delicious milk and cream.

<h2>We Couldn't and Wouldn't do it Without Them!</h2>
Austin is blessed with numerous farms and food artisans that work with Lick Ice Creams. From the fresh mint and earthy beets we get in East Austin, to the fragrant lavender and luscious peaches harvested in the Texas Hill Country out west, we base our flavors on what the land has to offer us and when the season is right for each ingredient.

We are also able to collaborate with amazing local food artisans, such as chocolatiers, bee keepers — and even butchers — who help enhance the quality and flavor profiles of our ice creams. They ensure that you’ll never find a mass-produced, generic marshmallow or a non-local hint of honey in any of our ice creams.

        "post_content": "There really is a Hazel and she’s my granny.  Each year for Thanksgiving she would make at least one pumpkin pie and she’d say it was just for me, usually by whispering it in my ear.  Maybe she didn’t want the other grandchildren to hear.  Whatever the reason, I LOVE her pumpkin pie.  I remember seeing them lined up with the other desserts on my grandparents’ bar and going out of my mind counting the minutes until it was time to dive in.  I’m a huge baked goods fanatic and even among all the other offerings my family members had crafted, my main objective was to get a piece of her pumpkin pie on my plate before it had been devoured by my cousins.

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1703\" alt=\"3-grannyhazel\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3-grannyhazel.jpg\" width=\"440\" height=\"282\" data-id=\"1703\" />

        "post_content": "Each day we are lucky enough to go to work at a place where we can explore new flavors, meet new people and be inspired by the state we live in.  Here at Lick Honest Ice Creams, we celebrate the farmers, produce, artisans and Texas nostalgia that surround us through the ice creams we create.  <!--more-->

&nbsp;

I’ve always been in love with both Texas and ice cream.  Growing up in Hallettsville, a small town settled by German and Czech immigrants, I had the great fortune of living in a community that appreciated and practiced the art of growing and crafting things in an honest way.   My grandparents had a farm and I relished walking in the fields and pastures with my family.  We’d walk in the shade and pick delicious, buttery Texas pecans, shelling and eating them as we took in the breeze.  I was always so impressed and proud to see my grandma selling her fresh produce at the farmers market on our town square.  This sense of pride I saw in my grandparents is what we all feel here toward our ice creams.

&nbsp;

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1666\" alt=\"1-hallettsville\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1-hallettsville.jpg\" width=\"440\" height=\"282\" data-id=\"1666\" />

&nbsp;

Every summer, which can extend from March to October, I made ice cream with my family.  We would of course make the standards but we also delighted in making flavors that featured the local bounty.  Pecan, peach and dewberry were my personal favorites.  We’d sit in the shade, one of us usually planted atop the ice cream maker, and one cranking away on the handle.   Now, we get to make ice cream like this (with the exception of the hand crank) everyday of the year.  From the local grass-fed milk and cream to the produce, chocolate and honey brought to us by the most amazing, down to earth farmers and artisans, we’re continually inspired.

&nbsp;

I share all of this as a way to convey just how connected I and all of us who work at Lick Honest Ice Creams feel to the ice creams we craft.  We get to make something we’re so proud of and head over heels in love with every day.  Thanks to all of our supporters for helping us do what we love to do.  We hope you love it too!

&nbsp;

I’ve always been in love with both Texas and ice cream.  Growing up in Hallettsville, a small town settled by German and Czech immigrants, I had the great fortune of living in a community that appreciated and practiced the art of growing and crafting things in an honest way.   My grandparents had a farm and I relished walking in the fields and pastures with my family.  We’d walk in the shade and pick delicious, buttery Texas pecans, shelling and eating them as we took in the breeze.  I was always so impressed and proud to see my grandma selling her fresh produce at the farmers market on our town square.  This sense of pride I saw in my grandparents is what we all feel here toward our ice creams.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Every summer, which can extend from March to October, I made ice cream with my family.  We would of course make the standards but we also delighted in making flavors that featured the local bounty.  Pecan, peach and dewberry were my personal favorites.  We’d sit in the shade, one of us usually planted atop the ice cream maker, and one cranking away on the handle.   Now, we get to make ice cream like this (with the exception of the hand crank) everyday of the year.  From the local grass-fed milk and cream to the produce, chocolate and honey brought to us by the most amazing, down to earth farmers and artisans, we’re continually inspired.

&nbsp;

I share all of this as a way to convey just how connected I and all of us who work at Lick Honest Ice Creams feel to the ice creams we craft.  We get to make something we’re so proud of and head over heels in love with every day.  Thanks to all of our supporters for helping us do what we love to do.  We hope you love it too!

I’ve always been in love with both Texas and ice cream.  Growing up in Hallettsville, a small town settled by German and Czech immigrants, I had the great fortune of living in a community that appreciated and practiced the art of growing and crafting things in an honest way.   My grandparents had a farm and I relished walking in the fields and pastures with my family.  We’d walk in the shade and pick delicious, buttery Texas pecans, shelling and eating them as we took in the breeze.  I was always so impressed and proud to see my grandma selling her fresh produce at the farmers market on our town square.  This sense of pride I saw in my grandparents is what we all feel here toward our ice creams.

&nbsp;

Every summer, which can extend from March to October, I made ice cream with my family.  We would of course make the standards but we also delighted in making flavors that featured the local bounty.  Pecan, peach and dewberry were my personal favorites.  We’d sit in the shade, one of us usually planted atop the ice cream maker, and one cranking away on the handle.   Now, we get to make ice cream like this (with the exception of the hand crank) everyday of the year.  From the local grass-fed milk and cream to the produce, chocolate and honey brought to us by the most amazing, down to earth farmers and artisans, we’re continually inspired.

&nbsp;

I share all of this as a way to convey just how connected I and all of us who work at Lick Honest Ice Creams feel to the ice creams we craft.  We get to make something we’re so proud of and head over heels in love with every day.  Thanks to all of our supporters for helping us do what we love to do.  We hope you love it too!

&nbsp;

Anthony and I bounced an idea for apple ice cream around for months, maybe even years.  I was admittedly the potential flavor’s antagonist – having grown up an apple snob in the northeast, I was nothing short of skeptical of Texas apples.  <!--more-->Anthony told me stories of going to orchards in the summer to pick apples.  In 100 degree weather?  When it’s too hot to ever rain?  When the grass turns to hay?  No way.  That sounds to me like a recipe for soft, mealy, ferment-y apples.  Cider apples.  Sauce apples.

&nbsp;

Let me tell you, I was so, so wrong.

&nbsp;

After living in Texas for 2 years, it was time to get over my Texas apple suspicion.  I’m putting it lightly when I say that Anthony was VERY excited.

&nbsp;

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1686\" alt=\"2-apples\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2-apples.jpg\" width=\"440\" height=\"282\" data-id=\"1686\" />

&nbsp;

We got really lucky this year.  Our first contact was Don Durflinger from a very quaint pick-your-own orchard in Mason, TX called Sonlight Orchard.  Don and his wife Sheila proudly own and run the orchard themselves.  Once I got a hold of Don, we spoke on the phone for about an hour sharing apple facts and stories.  I told him about all of the varieties of apples I ate right off of the tree in New York.  He told me how the apples in Texas are different from those that I described because his apples are sweeter, denser, greener, and absolutely delicious.  He told me that he does not retail or wholesale his apples because he wants for there to always be enough apples for the weekend pickers.  Don is proud of his orchard.  He loves his apples and loves watching people pick his apples.

&nbsp;

Despite everything Don told me, up until the moment that Anthony and I walked up to the Sonlight Orchard barn and were almost immediately handed chunks of apples to taste from Don &amp; Sheila’s hands, I was skeptical.  Then I tasted his Red Delicious, then Cameo, and finally Fuji.   Each was uniquely delicious.  Little apples with green and red skins and dense, crisp, and juicy flesh.  They were the most unique and most admirable little apples.  I love these apples too.

&nbsp;

<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1688\" alt=\"2-donandsheila\" src=\"http://ilikelick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2-donandsheila.jpg\" width=\"440\" height=\"282\" data-id=\"1688\" />

&nbsp;

Back in our kitchen, with the apples that Anthony, Don, Sheila, and I picked, we made the ultimate apple cheddar ice cream.

&nbsp;

Sweetened with a touch of honey and sugar (the apples are so sweet they barely need any sugar!), chunks of Don’s apples were baked until barely soft and simply blended into our ice cream base. Then, with some help from Henri’s Cheese, we found an awesome cheddar from Veldhuizen Cheese in Dublin, Texas, and turned it into a crunchy, cheesy, salty rosemary cheddar cracker.  It’s everything that reminds us of fall and we love it.  We love Texas apples (myself included)!

        "post_content": "Texas apples are impressive.

Anthony and I bounced an idea for apple ice cream around for months, maybe even years.  I was admittedly the potential flavor’s antagonist – having grown up an apple snob in the northeast, I was nothing short of skeptical of Texas apples.  Anthony told me stories of going to orchards in the summer to pick apples.  In 100 degree weather?  When it’s too hot to ever rain?  When the grass turns to hay?  No way.  That sounds to me like a recipe for soft, mealy, ferment-y apples.  Cider apples.  Sauce apples.

Let me tell you, I was so, so wrong.

After living in Texas for 2 years, it was time to get over my Texas apple suspicion.  I’m putting it lightly when I say that Anthony was VERY excited.

We got really lucky this year.  Our first contact was Don Durflinger from a very quaint pick-your-own orchard in Mason, TX called Sonlight Orchard.  Don and his wife Sheila proudly own and run the orchard themselves.  Once I got a hold of Don, we spoke on the phone for about an hour sharing apple facts and stories.  I told him about all of the varieties of apples I ate right off of the tree in New York.  He told me how the apples in Texas are different from those that I described because his apples are sweeter, denser, greener, and absolutely delicious.  He told me that he does not retail or wholesale his apples because he wants for there to always be enough apples for the weekend pickers.  Don is proud of his orchard.  He loves his apples and loves watching people pick his apples.

Despite everything Don told me, up until the moment that Anthony and I walked up to the Sonlight Orchard barn and were almost immediately handed chunks of apples to taste from Don &amp; Sheila’s hands, I was skeptical.  Then I tasted his Red Delicious, then Cameo, and finally Fuji.   Each was uniquely delicious.  Little apples with green and red skins and dense, crisp, and juicy flesh.  They were the most unique and most admirable little apples.  I love these apples too.

Back in our kitchen, with the apples that me, Anthony, Don, and Sheila picked, we made the ultimate apple cheddar ice cream.

Sweetened with a touch of honey and sugar (the apples are so sweet they barely need any sugar!), chunks of Don’s apples were baked until barely soft and simply blended into our ice cream base. Then, with some help from Henri’s Cheese, we found an awesome cheddar from Veldhuizen Cheese in Dublin, Texas, and turned it into a crunchy, cheesy, salty rosemary cheddar cracker.  It’s everything that reminds us of fall and we love it.  We love Texas apples (myself included)!

Anthony and I bounced an idea for apple ice cream around for months, maybe even years.  I was admittedly the potential flavor’s antagonist – having grown up an apple snob in the northeast, I was nothing short of skeptical of Texas apples.  Anthony told me stories of going to orchards in the summer to pick apples.  In 100 degree weather?  When it’s too hot to ever rain?  When the grass turns to hay?  No way.  That sounds to me like a recipe for soft, mealy, ferment-y apples.  Cider apples.  Sauce apples.

Let me tell you, I was so, so wrong.

After living in Texas for 2 years, it was time to get over my Texas apple suspicion.  I’m putting it lightly when I say that Anthony was VERY excited.

We got really lucky this year.  Our first contact was Don Durflinger from a very quaint pick-your-own orchard in Mason, TX called Sonlight Orchard.  Don and his wife Sheila proudly own and run the orchard themselves.  Once I got a hold of Don, we spoke on the phone for about an hour sharing apple facts and stories.  I told him about all of the varieties of apples I ate right off of the tree in New York.  He told me how the apples in Texas are different from those that I described because his apples are sweeter, denser, greener, and absolutely delicious.  He told me that he does not retail or wholesale his apples because he wants for there to always be enough apples for the weekend pickers.  Don is proud of his orchard.  He loves his apples and loves watching people pick his apples.

Despite everything Don told me, up until the moment that Anthony and I walked up to the Sonlight Orchard barn and were almost immediately handed chunks of apples to taste from Don &amp; Sheila’s hands, I was skeptical.  Then I tasted his Red Delicious, then Cameo, and finally Fuji.   Each was uniquely delicious.  Little apples with green and red skins and dense, crisp, and juicy flesh.  They were the most unique and most admirable little apples.  I love these apples too.

Back in our kitchen, with the apples that me, Anthony, Don, and Sheila picked, we made the ultimate apple cheddar ice cream.

Sweetened with a touch of honey and sugar (the apples are so sweet they barely need any sugar!), chunks of Don’s apples were baked until barely soft and simply blended into our ice cream base. Then, with some help from Henri’s Cheese, we found an awesome cheddar from Veldhuizen Cheese in Dublin, Texas, and turned it into a crunchy, cheesy, salty rosemary cheddar cracker.  It’s everything that reminds us of fall and we love it.  We love Texas apples (myself included)!

We only have a limited quantity of Don’s apples, so grab a scoop or pint of this flavor before they run out!",

Despite everything Don told me, up until the moment that Anthony and I walked up to the Sonlight Orchard barn and were almost immediately handed chunks of apples to taste from Don &amp; Sheila’s hands, I was skeptical.  Then I tasted his Red Delicious, then Cameo, and finally Fuji.   Each was uniquely delicious.  Little apples with green and red skins and dense, crisp, and juicy flesh.  They were the most unique and most admirable little apples.  I love these apples too.

Back in our kitchen, with the apples that me, Anthony, Don, and Sheila picked, we made the ultimate apple cheddar ice cream.

&nbsp;

Sweetened with a touch of honey and sugar (the apples are so sweet they barely need any sugar!), chunks of Don’s apples were baked until barely soft and simply blended into our ice cream base. Then, with some help from Henri’s Cheese, we found an awesome cheddar from Veldhuizen Cheese in Dublin, Texas, and turned it into a crunchy, cheesy, salty rosemary cheddar cracker.  It’s everything that reminds us of fall and we love it.  We love Texas apples (myself included)!

&nbsp;

We only have a limited quantity of Don’s apples, so grab a scoop or pint of this flavor before they run out!

Anthony and I bounced an idea for apple ice cream around for months, maybe even years.  I was admittedly the potential flavor’s antagonist – having grown up an apple snob in the northeast, I was nothing short of skeptical of Texas apples.  <!--more-->Anthony told me stories of going to orchards in the summer to pick apples.  In 100 degree weather?  When it’s too hot to ever rain?  When the grass turns to hay?  No way.  That sounds to me like a recipe for soft, mealy, ferment-y apples.  Cider apples.  Sauce apples.

So what made Hazel’s pumpkin pie leave such an impression on me, even after all these years?  Sure, you could assume that it was just the fact that my Granny, one of the women who taught me to bake and a person I love with all my heart, made the cake and I would of course love it out of my sheer emotional connection to the baker.   That is not the case.  Her pies really focused on the pumpkin.  So many times a pumpkin pie is loaded up with spices that the subtle, fresh flavor of the pumpkin is lost and it ends up tasting like a cinnamon pie with a dash of clove, nutmeg and ginger.  Granny’s pies were simple and delicious.  There was a nice balance of nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  She went a bit heavier on the clove, which I love.  I also remember eating her pumpkin pie and not feeling the need to cover it in whipped cream, although I have to admit (and I say this knowing I may be a bit judged) that there were times that I added a hefty dollop of cool-whip.

&nbsp;

Today, we pay homage to this lovely, feisty, Texas lady with the flavor Hazel’s Pumpkin Pie.  We buy Texas pie pumpkins and roast them in the oven in our very own kitchen.  Once the seeds and flesh have been removed, pounds of it are blended into our ice cream base and enhanced with a little nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  We go a bit heavy on the clove.  What we get is the best pumpkin ice cream I’ve ever had that tastes like the most delicious, freshest pumpkin pie I’ve ever eaten.  Actually, if you’ve never had the pleasure of eating my Granny’s pumpkin pie, it’s probably better.

So what made Hazel’s pumpkin pie leave such an impression on me, even after all these years?  Sure, you could assume that it was just the fact that my Granny, one of the women who taught me to bake and a person I love with all my heart, made the cake and I would of course love it out of my sheer emotional connection to the baker.   That is not the case.  Her pies really focused on the pumpkin.  So many times a pumpkin pie is loaded up with spices that the subtle, fresh flavor of the pumpkin is lost and it ends up tasting like a cinnamon pie with a dash of clove, nutmeg and ginger.  Granny’s pies were simple and delicious.  There was a nice balance of nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  She went a bit heavier on the clove, which I love.  I also remember eating her pumpkin pie and not feeling the need to cover it in whipped cream, although I have to admit (and I say this knowing I may be a bit judged) that there were times that I added a hefty dollop of cool-whip.

&nbsp;

Today, we pay homage to this lovely, feisty, Texas lady with the flavor Hazel’s Pumpkin Pie.  We buy Texas pie pumpkins and roast them in the oven in our very own kitchen.  Once the seeds and flesh have been removed, pounds of it are blended into our ice cream base and enhanced with a little nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  We go a bit heavy on the clove.  What we get is the best pumpkin ice cream I’ve ever had that tastes like the most delicious, freshest pumpkin pie I’ve ever eaten.  Actually, if you’ve never had the pleasure of eating my Granny’s pumpkin pie, it’s probably better.

This is Texas in November, folks.  There are cold fronts, rain, and sometimes (rarely) ice, but if you give it a couple of days, the sun always returns to warm you back up.  That's why I fled the Northeast as soon as I could.  I outright cannot tolerate cold... except for cold ice cream.

It's a little bit ironic, but I love ice cream MOST in the winter.

Ice cream serves a very special purpose in the winter.  It's an indulgent, belly-warming, sweet, and satisfying treat for the end of every dark winter day.  It's the best feel-good food.  Straight out of a pint with a really big spoon, scooped onto a warm slice of pecan pie, or floating in a tall glass of dark beer, ice cream seems to round out every dish, every meal, every day.

&nbsp;

I crave warm, rich foods &amp; drinks in cold weather.  Pie, cobbler, brownies, coffee, tea, hot chocolate.  With ice cream.  Have you ever had a scoop of vanilla ice cream in your coffee?  It's better than any coffee creamer.  In hot chocolate, it's better than marshmallows.  With a pint readily available in the freezer, you might find yourself savoring your ice cream straight out of the pint for hours because it takes so much longer to melt in the cold.  I've been nursing this still-frozen pint on my desk for an hour ... as if there aren't already enough reasons to love ice cream in this weather.

<div>This is Texas in November, folks.  There are cold fronts, rain, and sometimes (rarely) ice, but if you give it a couple of days, the sun always returns to warm you back up.  That's why I fled the Northeast as soon as I could.  I outright cannot tolerate cold... except for cold ice cream.</div>

<div>Ice cream serves a very special purpose in the winter.  It's an indulgent, belly-warming, sweet, and satisfying treat for the end of every dark winter day.  It's the best feel-good food.  Straight out of a pint with a really big spoon, scooped onto a warm slice of pecan pie, or floating in a tall glass of dark beer, ice cream seems to round out every dish, every meal, every day.</div>

<div>I crave warm, rich foods &amp; drinks in cold weather.  If you do too, then you definitely want some of these this season.  With a scoop of ice cream.  Or you might just find yourself savoring your ice cream straight out of the pint for hours because it takes so much longer to melt in the cold.  I've been nursing this still-frozen pint on my desk for an hour ... as if there aren't already enough reasons to love ice cream in this weather.</div>

<!--more-->

Yes, the chocolate is usually cold and hard and, yes, if you’re anything like me you sometimes impatiently but accidentally force your marshmallow so deep into the campfire that it bursts into flames.  But it’s all cool because that’s what s’mores are about.  Camping, fires, junk food, sleeping (or not sleeping), bugs, grass, dirt, and a sky full of stars.  Oh, and s’mores.  Always s’mores.

&nbsp;

We like s’mores a LOT.  Where I’m from, s’more time is in the summertime.  But according to Anthony, s’more weather is cold weather in Texas.  We agree to disagree.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

No matter the time of year, we like cold, hard chunks of chocolate and melted (sometimes burnt) marshmallows cozily stacked between two cinnamon and honey graham crackers.  Our S’more Meringue ice cream captures all of that.  We flavor the ice cream with Austin Honey Company honey, cinnamon, and molasses (it tastes just like a graham cracker) and then sprinkle in some shattered bits of dark Great Bean chocolate.

&nbsp;

It’s the thick swirl of torched meringue that makes our s’more a S’more Meringue.  Our made-in-house pillow-y soft meringue tastes just like the burnt edges and ooey gooey center of melted marshmallows.  And quite honestly, it’s perfect.

&nbsp;

We don’t camp much around here, but we really don't need to when we have S’more Meringue ice cream in our freezer.

Yes, the chocolate is usually cold and hard and, yes, if you’re anything like me you sometimes impatiently but accidentally force your marshmallow so deep into the campfire that it bursts into flames.  But it’s all cool because that’s what s’mores are about.  Camping, fires, junk food, sleeping (or not sleeping), bugs, grass, dirt, and a sky full of stars.  Oh, and s’mores.  Always s’mores.

&nbsp;

We like s’mores a LOT.  Where I’m from, s’more time is in the summertime.  But according to Anthony, s’more weather is cold weather in Texas.  We agree to disagree.

&nbsp;

No matter the time of year, we like cold, hard chunks of chocolate and melted (sometimes burnt) marshmallows cozily stacked between two cinnamon and honey graham crackers.  Our S’more Meringue ice cream captures all of that.  We flavor the ice cream with Austin Honey Company honey, cinnamon, and molasses (it tastes just like a graham cracker) and then sprinkle in some shattered bits of dark Great Bean chocolate.

&nbsp;

It’s the thick swirl of torched meringue that makes our s’more a S’more Meringue.  Our made-in-house pillow-y soft meringue tastes just like the burnt edges and ooey gooey center of melted marshmallows.  And quite honestly, it’s perfect.

&nbsp;

We don’t camp much around here, but we really don't need to when we have S’more Meringue ice cream in our freezer.

Yes, the chocolate is usually cold and hard and, yes, if you’re anything like me you sometimes impatiently but accidentally force your marshmallow so deep into the campfire that it bursts into flames.  But it’s all cool because that’s what s’mores are about.  Camping, fires, junk food, sleeping (or not sleeping), bugs, grass, dirt, and a sky full of stars.  Oh, and s’mores.  Always s’mores.

&nbsp;

We like s’mores a LOT.  Where I’m from, s’more time is in the summertime.  But according to Anthony, s’more weather is cold weather in Texas.  We agree to disagree.

&nbsp;

No matter the time of year, we like cold, hard chunks of chocolate and melted (sometimes burnt) marshmallows cozily stacked between two cinnamon and honey graham crackers.  Our S’more Meringue ice cream captures all of that.  We flavor the ice cream with Austin Honey Company honey, cinnamon, and molasses (it tastes just like a graham cracker) and then sprinkle in some shattered bits of dark Great Bean chocolate.

&nbsp;

It’s the thick swirl of torched meringue that makes our s’more a S’more Meringue.  Our made-in-house pillow-y soft meringue tastes just like the burnt edges and ooey gooey center of melted marshmallows.  And quite honestly, it’s perfect.

&nbsp;

We don’t camp much around here, but we really don't need to when we have S’more Meringue ice cream in our freezer.

Just recently we were asked to participate in the Big Reds and Bubbles event at the historic Driskill Hotel.  Being that the event was centered around an extensive wine tasting, we decided to create a flavor that celebrated that.  For some time, I’d been longing to create a flavor that was in some part crafted using a local wine.  More recently, my focus had been on incorporating the wine into a cake that could be featured in our ice cream.  This event seemed like the perfect opportunity to see this notion to fruition.

First we decided on the cake.  There was some talk of a white or yellow cake but I was dead set on chocolate.  So chocolate it was.  Next we selected the wine.  Personally, I’m not a fan of merlots in general so I knew I wanted to stir clear of that varietal.  I landed on a cabernet sauvignon from one of my favorite vineyards in the Texas Hill Country; Becker Vineyards.  The combination of the wine with the delicious cake that Diana created was right on.  Not wanting to take away from the varied notes of the wine cake, the base was a vanilla bean cream cheese.

&nbsp;

Cabernet Cake and Cream, as we call it, was very well received at the event and everyone was asking ‘How did you come up with this flavor’ and ‘When will it be in your shops?’.  Now  you know the how and it looks like the when will be this coming Valentine’s Day.

        "post_content": "Everyone does Thanksgiving differently. My family does the same traditional Thanksgiving meal every year including roasted turkey, stuffing, gravy, chunky cranberry sauce, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, creamed onions, and pie. A whole lot of pie! Pie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream from a can. Pumpkin pie, apple pie, and pecan pie. So much pie that, at the end of a day devoted to eating, my family is almost always reluctant to even look at the pie.<!--more-->

&nbsp;

Despite the fact that we barely start and rarely finish dessert, nothing says Thanksgiving more to me than pie.
Thanksgiving pie is pecan pie, pumpkin pie, apple pie, buttermilk pie, sweet potato pie, all kinds of pie. I love a rich, silky pumpkin pie most. My grandma prefers my mom’s sticky brown sugar pecan pie. My sister wants the tart, crunchy apple pie. Regardless of the flavor of pie we choose, we always top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. This is how it’s always been and this is how it always will be (which is why we always have more pie than we could ever eat.) Thanksgiving is essentially pie-giving, where everyone gets what they want.

&nbsp;

I always want to make my own pie. I love the attention that goes into preparing the fruit, the crust, and the perfectly scalloped edges, but I don’t always love the time needed to bake a beautiful show-stopping pie. When I don’t have the time, I buy. And when I buy, I buy Austin’s own Tiny Pies. The biggest benefit, in my opinion, of putting less time into the pie is that I get more time for picking out my favorite flavor of ice cream to pair with the pie. I always need ice cream with my pie.

&nbsp;

Everyone does Thanksgiving pie differently. Some people might not make a pie at all but I sure don’t know them. Do you?

Just recently we were asked to participate in the Big Reds and Bubbles event at the historic Driskill Hotel.  Being that the event was centered around an extensive wine tasting, we decided to create a flavor that celebrated that.  For some time, I’d been longing to create a flavor that was in some part crafted using a local wine.  More recently, my focus had been on incorporating the wine into a cake that could be featured in our ice cream.  This event seemed like the perfect opportunity to see this notion to fruition.

&nbsp;

First we decided on the cake.  There was some talk of a white or yellow cake but I was dead set on chocolate.  So chocolate it was.  Next we selected the wine.  Personally, I’m not a fan of merlots in general so I knew I wanted to stir clear of that varietal.  I landed on a cabernet sauvignon from one of my favorite vineyards in the Texas Hill Country; Becker Vineyards.  The combination of the wine with the delicious cake that Diana created was right on.  Not wanting to take away from the varied notes of the wine cake, the base was a vanilla bean cream cheese.

&nbsp;

Cabernet Cake and Cream, as we call it, was very well received at the event and everyone was asking ‘How did you come up with this flavor’ and ‘When will it be in your shops?’.  Now  you know the how and it looks like the when will be this coming Valentine’s Day.

My family does the same traditional Thanksgiving meal every year including roasted turkey, stuffing, gravy, chunky cranberry sauce, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, creamed onions, and pie. A whole lot of pie! Pie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream from a can. Pumpkin pie, apple pie, and pecan pie. So much pie that, at the end of a day devoted to eating, my family is almost always reluctant to even look at the pie.<!--more-->

&nbsp;
Despite the fact that we barely start and rarely finish dessert, nothing says Thanksgiving more to me than pie.
Thanksgiving pie is pecan pie, pumpkin pie, apple pie, buttermilk pie, sweet potato pie, all kinds of pie. I love a rich, silky pumpkin pie most. My grandma prefers my mom’s sticky brown sugar pecan pie. My sister wants the tart, crunchy apple pie. Regardless of the flavor of pie we choose, we always top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. This is how it’s always been and this is how it always will be (which is why we always have more pie than we could ever eat.) Thanksgiving is essentially pie-giving, where everyone gets what they want.

&nbsp;
I always want to make my own pie. I love the attention that goes into preparing the fruit, the crust, and the perfectly scalloped edges, but I don’t always love the time needed to bake a beautiful show-stopping pie. When I don’t have the time, I buy. And when I buy, I buy Austin’s own Tiny Pies. The biggest benefit, in my opinion, of putting less time into the pie is that I get more time for picking out my favorite flavor of ice cream to pair with the pie. I always need ice cream with my pie.

Everyone does Thanksgiving pie differently. Some people might not make a pie at all but I sure don’t know them. Do you?

        "post_content": "Everyone does Thanksgiving differently. My family does the same traditional Thanksgiving meal every year including roasted turkey, stuffing, gravy, chunky cranberry sauce, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, creamed onions, and pie. A whole lot of pie! Pie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream from a can. Pumpkin pie, apple pie, and pecan pie. So much pie that, at the end of a day devoted to eating, my family is almost always reluctant to even look at the pie.<!--more-->

&nbsp;

Despite the fact that we barely start and rarely finish dessert, nothing says Thanksgiving more to me than pie.

&nbsp;
Thanksgiving pie is pecan pie, pumpkin pie, apple pie, buttermilk pie, sweet potato pie, all kinds of pie. I love a rich, silky pumpkin pie most. My grandma prefers my mom’s sticky brown sugar pecan pie. My sister wants the tart, crunchy apple pie. Regardless of the flavor of pie we choose, we always top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. This is how it’s always been and this is how it always will be (which is why we always have more pie than we could ever eat.) Thanksgiving is essentially pie-giving, where everyone gets what they want.

&nbsp;

I always want to make my own pie. I love the attention that goes into preparing the fruit, the crust, and the perfectly scalloped edges, but I don’t always love the time needed to bake a beautiful show-stopping pie. When I don’t have the time, I buy. And when I buy, I buy Austin’s own Tiny Pies. The biggest benefit, in my opinion, of putting less time into the pie is that I get more time for picking out my favorite flavor of ice cream to pair with the pie. I always need ice cream with my pie.

&nbsp;

Everyone does Thanksgiving pie differently. Some people might not make a pie at all but I sure don’t know them. Do you?

<!--more-->

&nbsp;

As with most of our flavors, we dwelled on an idea for a beer ice cream for as long as I can remember.  There’s a lot of good beer in Texas.  We love beer.  And as you might imagine, good beer is great with good ice cream.

&nbsp;

Scotch Ales are quickly becoming one of my favorite types of beer.  They feature a malt-dominant profile, very low bitterness, and higher than average alcohol content.  In other words, they’re bubbly, slightly sweet, full bodied brews that are so dangerously smooth they’ll knock you off your feet.  Their warm flavor makes them perfect for the holidays.  Their minimal hop presence and low bitterness also make them perfect for ice cream – a Scotch Ale can be reduced without becoming unpalatably bitter (try cooking any IPA down to syrup and you’ll see what I mean).

&nbsp;

We get our Scotch Ale from Guadalupe Brewing Company in New Braunfels, just a stone’s throw away from Austin.  It’s a little bit smoky, sweet, malty, and aged in American oak.  It’s unique, yet balanced, and we love it.

&nbsp;

Not only does this beer make a fine ice cream, but it also makes a mean gingerbread.  Made with loads of zingy fresh ginger, cinnamon, molasses, and a frothy glass of Guadalupe Brewing Company’s Scotch Ale, this gingerbread’s got a punch.  I highly recommend picking up a pint of ice cream to eat and a pint of Scotch Ale to wash it down for the holidays.  The flavors go so well together.  They make me holiday happy (and I’m not just saying that because I made it, I swear!).

Scotch Ales are quickly becoming one of my favorite types of beer.  They feature a malt-dominant profile, very low bitterness, and higher than average alcohol content.  In other words, they’re bubbly, slightly sweet, full bodied brews that are so dangerously smooth they’ll knock you off your feet.  Their warm flavor makes them perfect for the holidays.  Their minimal hop presence and low bitterness also make them perfect for ice cream – a Scotch Ale can be reduced without becoming unpalatably bitter (try cooking any IPA down to syrup and you’ll see what I mean).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We get our Scotch Ale from Guadalupe Brewing Company in New Braunfels, just a stone’s throw away from Austin.  It’s a little bit smoky, sweet, malty, and aged in American oak.  It’s unique, yet balanced, and we love it.

&nbsp;

Not only does this beer make a fine ice cream, but it also makes a mean gingerbread.  Made with loads of zingy fresh ginger, cinnamon, molasses, and a frothy glass of Guadalupe Brewing Company’s Scotch Ale, this gingerbread’s got a punch.  I highly recommend picking up a pint of ice cream to eat and a pint of Scotch Ale to wash it down for the holidays.  The flavors go so well together.  They make me holiday happy (and I’m not just saying that because I made it, I swear!).

Emily leads the churning team.  She grew up in Austin, spent a few years in NYC, and (lucky for us) began working at Lick shortly after her return to Texas.  In Austin and in New York, Emily gained years of experience cooking great food for well respected restaurants, cafes, and catering companies.  She’s an exceptionally talented cook.  There’s a good chance that Emily inspired the delicious new flavor that we recently introduced and an even better chance that she churned it.  In all seriousness, Emily makes the most beautiful swirls we’ve ever seen.

Claire started at Lick writing lids and quickly took over all of our ice cream prep work.  After graduating from pastry school in Colorado, she moved to Austin to pursue chocolate.  She loves chocolate.  She makes the prettiest molded chocolates and sometimes brings them to work to share with the sweet fiends in the office.  (Thank you, Claire!)  We’re so lucky that Claire also loves ice cream because she’s really good at making it.  The beautifully executed cakes, luscious curds, sauces, and every one of our components are all thanks to her.

&nbsp;

Alyssa is a pastry school graduate, native Austinite, and newest addition to our team.  She came to us after a few months of high altitude baking in the mountains of Colorado.  She’s an avid baker and, unlike many, quickly mastered packing ice cream into a pint – it truly is so much harder than it looks!  She clearly knows how to wield a spatula.  And of all of us in the kitchen, Alyssa treats us to more homemade desserts than the rest of us combined.  (Did I mention that we like sweets?)

Emily leads the churning team.  She grew up in Austin, spent a few years in NYC, and (lucky for us) began working at Lick shortly after her return to Texas.  In Austin and in New York, Emily gained years of experience cooking great food for well respected restaurants, cafes, and catering companies.  She’s an exceptionally talented cook.  There’s a good chance that Emily inspired the delicious new flavor that we recently introduced and an even better chance that she churned it.  In all seriousness, Emily makes the most beautiful swirls we’ve ever seen.

Claire started at Lick writing lids and quickly took over all of our ice cream prep work.  After graduating from pastry school in Colorado, she moved to Austin to pursue chocolate.  She loves chocolate.  She makes the prettiest molded chocolates and sometimes brings them to work to share with the sweet fiends in the office.  (Thank you, Claire!)  We’re so lucky that Claire also loves ice cream because she’s really good at making it.  The beautifully executed cakes, luscious curds, sauces, and every one of our components are all thanks to her.

&nbsp;

Alyssa is a pastry school graduate, native Austinite, and newest addition to our team.  She came to us after a few months of high altitude baking in the mountains of Colorado.  She’s an avid baker and, unlike many, quickly mastered packing ice cream into a pint – it truly is so much harder than it looks!  She clearly knows how to wield a spatula.  And of all of us in the kitchen, Alyssa treats us to more homemade desserts than the rest of us combined.  (Did I mention that we like sweets?)

        "post_content": "Our kitchen staff is awesome.  Although we’re forever growing – soon to open new shops and add our ice cream to the shelves of more grocery stores both big and small around the state – there are just a few skilled hands working every day to make our ice cream. <!--more--> They put the stickers on every pint, hand write the flavors on every pint lid, bake every cake and component from scratch, chop every bunch of herbs,  swirl every sauce into each tub of ice cream, and hand pack every pint.  They work really hard to make sure that the ice cream y’all enjoy is as good as it can possibly be.

Emily leads the churning team.  She grew up in Austin, spent a few years in NYC, and (lucky for us) began working at Lick shortly after her return to Texas.  In Austin and in New York, Emily gained years of experience cooking great food for well respected restaurants, cafes, and catering companies.  She’s an exceptionally talented cook.  There’s a good chance that Emily inspired the delicious new flavor that we recently introduced and an even better chance that she churned it.  In all seriousness, Emily makes the most beautiful swirls we’ve ever seen.

Claire started at Lick writing lids and quickly took over all of our ice cream prep work.  After graduating from pastry school in Colorado, she moved to Austin to pursue chocolate.  She loves chocolate.  She makes the prettiest molded chocolates and sometimes brings them to work to share with the sweet fiends in the office.  (Thank you, Claire!)  We’re so lucky that Claire also loves ice cream because she’s really good at making it.  The beautifully executed cakes, luscious curds, sauces, and every one of our components are all thanks to her.

&nbsp;

Alyssa is a pastry school graduate, native Austinite, and newest addition to our team.  She came to us after a few months of high altitude baking in the mountains of Colorado.  She’s an avid baker and, unlike many, quickly mastered packing ice cream into a pint – it truly is so much harder than it looks!  She clearly knows how to wield a spatula.  And of all of us in the kitchen, Alyssa treats us to more homemade desserts than the rest of us combined.  (Did I mention that we like sweets?)

&nbsp;

This year, we built our first walk-in freezer, began selling at Central Market and Whole Foods, opened our second store at Pearl in San Antonio, participated in so many awesome local events, made ice cream sandwiches, ice cream cakes, ice cream sundaes, ice cream milkshakes, and floats.  We introduced delicious new flavors and made, sold, and donated more ice cream than ever before!

We’re so thankful for our staff, everyone we work with, and all of our awesome customers.  Because of y’all, we can continue doing what we love.  Thank you for being a part of this incredible year.  I can't wait for everything that's in store for 2015.

Happy New Year, everybody!

So, it dawned on me that none of y'all get to have the pleasure of knowing these kind, genuine folks.  I just don't feel that is fair.  To remedy this, we're going to profile some of our staff over the next year.  I've compiled a list of questions for each person to complete that will allow you to get to know them as I do.

<p style=\"text-align: right;\">-  Anthony Sobotik,  co-owner &amp; chef</p>
&nbsp;

First up is our lovely office manager.  Everyone,  meet Juliet!

&nbsp;

<strong>Full name: </strong>Juliet Anelie Dill

&nbsp;

<strong>Date of Birth</strong>:  December 8th, 1977

&nbsp;

<strong>Natural Hair Color</strong>:  Red!!

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite color(s)</strong>:  Deep blue, Magenta, Purple, and Emerald Green

&nbsp;

<strong>What I love most about living in Austin</strong>:  Being a Mama of a 3.5 year old little boy, my husband and I love all the things Austin has to offer families.  There aren't many towns where you can go out and meet your friends, have a drink while the kids play, and listen to some amazing live music.  Austin also has so much art and community based events centered around nature, farming, and creativity.  In its heart though, Austin is a little hippie town with great style and a funky vibe that brings together an eclectic mix of people.  Last but certainly not least -- TacoDeli breakfast tacos.  When we moved to Boulder a few years ago, breakfast tacos were nowhere to be found and we were in a breakfast fog for the four year we lived there.

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite musician (doesn't have to be Madonna, but it couldn't hurt)</strong>:  Well besides Madonna, of course... There's no way I can pick only one; my favorites are G. Love, John Butler, Art Tatum, Amos Lee, The Black Keys, Blind Melon, Van Morrisson, Eddie Bedder, Imogen Heap, and you know a lil' Beyonce never hurts.

&nbsp;

<strong>Cat or dog person: </strong>Dog!! (or hedgehog)

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite 'life saying' or quote or 'words to live by': </strong>If you want to know what \"should have\" happened, look at what \"did\" happen.

&nbsp;

<strong>What I do at Lick</strong>:  I'm the office manager and right hand gal for the amazing owners, Anthony and Chad.  I handle wholesale, event coordination, bookkeeping, charitable donations, and anything else they throw my way.

&nbsp;

<strong>Why I love my job</strong>:  I love how Lick participates in the community and gives so much back to the people of Austin.  I love supporting local farms and artisans and on the flipside the magic that brings to our business.  I love how Lick truly is an honest company in every facet of the business.  I am grateful to work with an amazing group of individuals that light up my days.  Each and every member of our team has such a big heart and huge personality.  \"The boys,\" as I collectively call Anthony and Chad, are two of the best bosses I could ask for.  They are incredibly approachable, always open to growth, and move through challenges with grace and humor.  It feels like we are all in this together and it's always a team effort.  But I will say that my most favorite thing about my job is how much I laugh.  Seriously.  My days are full of laughter and it makes my world a lighter place.

&nbsp;

<strong>Time with Lick</strong>:  9 months

&nbsp;

<strong>Why I love ice cream</strong>:  Ice cream makes everyone happy!

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite flavor</strong>:  Blushing Blueberry.... Oh how I can't wait for its return.  A couple weeks ago, our kitchen manager, Diana, found some forgotten pints of it in the freezer and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven with a spoon.  Two scoops!

This year, we built our first walk-in freezer, began selling at Central Market and Whole Foods, opened our second store at Pearl in San Antonio, participated in so many awesome local events, made ice cream sandwiches, ice cream cakes, ice cream sundaes, ice cream milkshakes.  We introduced delici new flavors and made, sold, and donated more ice cream than ever before!

We’re so thankful for our staff, everyone we work with, and all of our faithful customers.  Because of y’all, we can continue doing what we love.  Thank you for being a part of this incredible year.  I can't wait for everything that's in store for 2015.

Happy New Year, everybody!

        "post_content": "Did you know that there are 190 flavor combinations every day to choose from at our scoop shops?  That’s a new pairing every day for half a year!  Add that to the five flavors we rotate seasonally, six times per year, and you get 85 new flavor combinations every two months.  That’s tremendous.  And a ton of ice cream possibility.<!--more-->

&nbsp;

When we create a season’s flavor lineup, we want to create a story.  20 flavors narrate the story of the season, the holidays, Texas, and our own favorite flavor memories.  Fortunately for everyone, the seasonal theme always seems to yield a beautifully cohesive variety of flavors.  What grows together goes together, you know?

&nbsp;

My mind is constantly blown by the creative and unexpected favorite pairings that our scoopers and customers come up with.  We think we know what y’all will like, but we just don’t.  Cilantro Lime with Coconut, Peanut Butter &amp; Chocolate Swirl?  I never would have anticipated this one, but our South Lamar scoopers (Tamara in particular) vow that together they’re life-changing.  Goat Cheese, Thyme &amp; Honey with Roasted Beets &amp; Fresh Mint is another year-round favorite because, as Claudia at South Lamar told me, goat cheese tastes like happiness and beets look like happiness.  How could you go wrong with that?

&nbsp;

We’re just a couple of weeks away from rotating our seasonal flavors (again!), but there’s still plenty of time to try these favorite pairings of the season:

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Rachel recommends:  <em>Candied Pecan &amp; Bourbon with Peppermint Bark</em>,  <em>Coconut Chia Chai with Orange Coconut Marmalade</em><b>
</b></li>
	<li>Alexa recommends: <em>Texas au Lait with Orange Chocolate</em></li>
	<li>Summer recommends: <strong> </strong><em>Gingerbread Scotch Ale  with  Candied Pecan &amp; Bourbon</em></li>
	<li>Katie recommends:  <em>Peppermint Bark  with  Pecans &amp; Cream</em></li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

When we create a season’s flavor lineup, we want to create a story.  20 flavors narrate the story of the season, the holidays, Texas, and our own favorite flavor memories.  Fortunately for everyone, the seasonal theme always seems to yield a beautifully cohesive variety of flavors.  What grows together goes together, you know?

&nbsp;

My mind is constantly blown by the creative and unexpected favorite pairings that our scoopers and customers come up with.  We think we know what y’all will like, but we just don’t.  Cilantro Lime with Chocolate, Peanut Butter &amp; Chocolate Swirl?  I never would have anticipated this one, but our South Lamar scoopers (Tamara in particular) vow that together they’re life-changing.  Goat Cheese, Thyme &amp; Honey with Roasted Beets &amp; Fresh Mint is another year-round favorite because, as Claudia at South Lamar told me, goat cheese tastes like happiness and beets look like happiness.  How could you go wrong with that?

&nbsp;

We’re just a couple of weeks away from rotating our seasonal flavors (again!), but there’s still plenty of time to try these favorite pairings of the season:

&nbsp;

When we create a season’s flavor lineup, we want to create a story.  20 flavors narrate the story of the season, the holidays, Texas, and our own favorite flavor memories.  Fortunately for everyone, the seasonal theme always seems to yield a beautifully cohesive variety of flavors.  What grows together goes together, you know?

&nbsp;

My mind is constantly blown by the creative and unexpected favorite pairings that our scoopers and customers come up with.  We think we know what y’all will like, but we just don’t.  Cilantro Lime with Coconut, Peanut Butter &amp; Chocolate Swirl?  I never would have anticipated this one, but our South Lamar scoopers (Tamara in particular) vow that together they’re life-changing.  Goat Cheese, Thyme &amp; Honey with Roasted Beets &amp; Fresh Mint is another year-round favorite because, as Claudia at South Lamar told me, goat cheese tastes like happiness and beets look like happiness.  How could you go wrong with that?

We’re just a couple of weeks away from rotating our seasonal flavors (again!), but there’s still plenty of time to try these favorite pairings of the season:

&nbsp;

First up is our lovely office manager.  Everyone,  meet Juliet!

&nbsp;

<strong>Full name: </strong>Juliet Anelie Dill

&nbsp;

<strong>Date of Birth</strong>:  December 8th, 1977

&nbsp;

<strong>Natural Hair Color</strong>:  Red!!

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite color(s)</strong>:  Deep blue, Magenta, Purple, and Emerald Green

&nbsp;

<strong>What I love most about living in Austin</strong>:  Being a Mama of a 3.5 year old little boy, my husband and I love all the things Austin has to offer families.  There aren't many towns where you can go out and meet your friends, have a drink while the kids play, and listen to some amazing live music.  Austin also has so much art and community based events centered around nature, farming, and creativity.  In its heart though, Austin is a little hippie town with great style and a funky vibe that brings together an eclectic mix of people.  Last but certainly not least -- TacoDeli breakfast tacos.  When we moved to Boulder a few years ago, breakfast tacos were nowhere to be found and we were in a breakfast fog for the four year we lived there.

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite musician (doesn't have to be Madonna, but it couldn't hurt)</strong>:  Well besides Madonna, of course... There's no way I can pick only one; my favorites are G. Love, John Butler, Art Tatum, Amos Lee, The Black Keys, Blind Melon, Van Morrisson, Eddie Bedder, Imogen Heap, and you know a lil' Beyonce never hurts.

&nbsp;

<strong>Cat or dog person: </strong>Dog!! (or hedgehog)

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite 'life saying' or quote or 'words to live by': </strong>If you want to know what \"should have\" happened, look at what \"did\" happen.

&nbsp;

<strong>What I do at Lick</strong>:  I'm the office manager and right hand gal for the amazing owners, Anthony and Chad.  I handle wholesale, event coordination, bookkeeping, charitable domations, and anything else they throw my way.

&nbsp;

<strong>Why I love my job</strong>:  I love how Lick participates in the community and gives so much back to the people of Austin.  I love supporting local farms and artisans and on the flipside the magic that brings to our business.  I love how Lick truly is an honest company in every facet of the business.  I am grateful to work with an amazing group of individuals that light up my days.  Each and every member of our team has such a big heart and huge personality.  \"The boys,\" as I collectively call Anthony and Chad, are two of the best bosses I could ask for.  They are incredibly approachable, always open to growth, and move through challenges with grace and humor.  It feels like we are all in this together and it's always a team effort.  But I will say that my most favorite thing about my job is how much I laugh.  Seriously.  My days are full of laughter and it makes my world a lighter place.

&nbsp;

<strong>Time with Lick</strong>:  9 months

&nbsp;

<strong>Why I love ice cream</strong>:  Ice cream makes everyone happy!

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite flavor</strong>:  Blushing Blueberry.... Oh how I can't wait for its return.  A couple weeks ago, our kitchen manager, Diana, found some forgotten pints of it in the freezer and I thought I'd died a",

<strong>What I love most about living in Austin</strong>:  Being a Mama of a 3.5 year old little boy, my husband and I love all the things Austin has to offer families.  There aren't many towns where you can go out and meet your friends, have a drink while the kids play, and listen to some amazing live music.  Austin also has so much art and community based events centered around nature, farming, and creativity.  In its heart though, Austin is a little hippie town with great style and a funky vibe that brings together an eclectic mix of people.  Last but certainly not least -- TacoDeli breakfast tacos.  When we moved to Boulder a few years ago, breakfast tacos were nowhere to be found and we were in a breakfast fog for the four year we lived there.

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite musician (doesn't have to be Madonna, but it couldn't hurt)</strong>:  Well besides Madonna, of course... There's no way I can pick only one; my favorites are G. Love, John Butler, Art Tatum, Amos Lee, The Black Keys, Blind Melon, Van Morrisson, Eddie Bedder, Imogen Heap, and you know a lil' Beyonce never hurts.

&nbsp;

<strong>Cat or dog person: </strong>Dog!! (or hedgehog)

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite 'life saying' or quote or 'words to live by': </strong>If you want to know what \"should have\" happened, look at what \"did\" happen.

&nbsp;

<strong>What I do at Lick</strong>:  I'm the office manager and right hand gal for the amazing owners, Anthony and Chad.  I handle wholesale, event coordination, bookkeeping, charitable domations, and anything else they throw my way.

&nbsp;

<strong>Why I love my job</strong>:  I love how Lick participates in the community and gives so much back to the people of Austin.  I love supporting local farms and artisans and on the flipside the magic that brings to our business.  I love how Lick truly is an honest company in every facet of the business.  I am grateful to work with an amazing group of individuals that light up my days.  Each and every member of our team has such a big heart and huge personality.  \"The boys,\" as I collectively call Anthony and Chad, are two of the best bosses I could ask for.  They are incredibly approachable, always open to growth, and move through challenges with grace and humor.  It feels like we are all in this together and it's always a team effort.  But I will say that my most favorite thing about my job is how much I laugh.  Seriously.  My days are full of laughter and it makes my world a lighter place.

&nbsp;

<strong>Time with Lick</strong>:  9 months

&nbsp;

<strong>Why I love ice cream</strong>:  Ice cream makes everyone happy!

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite flavor</strong>:  Blushing Blueberry.... Oh how I can't wait for its return.  A couple weeks ago, our kitchen manager, Diana, found some forgotten pints of it in the freezer and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven with a spoon.  Two scoops!",

So, it dawned on me that none of y'all get to have the pleasure of knowing these kind, genuine folks.  I just don't feel that is fair.  To remedy this, we're going to profile some of our staff over the next year.  I've compiled a list of questions for each person to complete that will allow you to get to know them as I do.

&nbsp;
<p style=\"text-align: right;\">-  Anthony Sobotik,  co-owner &amp; chef</p>
&nbsp;

First up is our lovely office manager.  Everyone,  meet Juliet!

&nbsp;

<strong>Full name: </strong>Juliet Anelie Dill

&nbsp;

<strong>Date of Birth</strong>:  December 8th, 1977

&nbsp;

<strong>Natural Hair Color</strong>:  Red!!

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite color(s)</strong>:  Deep blue, Magenta, Purple, and Emerald Green

&nbsp;

<strong>What I love most about living in Austin</strong>:  Being a Mama of a 3.5 year old little boy, my husband and I love all the things Austin has to offer families.  There aren't many towns where you can go out and meet your friends, have a drink while the kids play, and listen to some amazing live music.  Austin also has so much art and community based events centered around nature, farming, and creativity.  In its heart though, Austin is a little hippie town with great style and a funky vibe that brings together an eclectic mix of people.  Last but certainly not least -- TacoDeli breakfast tacos.  When we moved to Boulder a few years ago, breakfast tacos were nowhere to be found and we were in a breakfast fog for the four year we lived there.

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite musician (doesn't have to be Madonna, but it couldn't hurt)</strong>:  Well besides Madonna, of course... There's no way I can pick only one; my favorites are G. Love, John Butler, Art Tatum, Amos Lee, The Black Keys, Blind Melon, Van Morrisson, Eddie Bedder, Imogen Heap, and you know a lil' Beyonce never hurts.

&nbsp;

<strong>Cat or dog person: </strong>Dog!! (or hedgehog)

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite 'life saying' or quote or 'words to live by': </strong>If you want to know what \"should have\" happened, look at what \"did\" happen.

&nbsp;

<strong>What I do at Lick</strong>:  I'm the office manager and right hand gal for the amazing owners, Anthony and Chad.  I handle wholesale, event coordination, bookkeeping, charitable domations, and anything else they throw my way.

&nbsp;

<strong>Why I love my job</strong>:  I love how Lick participates in the community and gives so much back to the people of Austin.  I love supporting local farms and artisans and on the flipside the magic that brings to our business.  I love how Lick truly is an honest company in every facet of the business.  I am grateful to work with an amazing group of individuals that light up my days.  Each and every member of our team has such a big heart and huge personality.  \"The boys,\" as I collectively call Anthony and Chad, are two of the best bosses I could ask for.  They are incredibly approachable, always open to growth, and move through challenges with grace and humor.  It feels like we are all in this together and it's always a team effort.  But I will say that my most favorite thing about my job is how much I laugh.  Seriously.  My days are full of laughter and it makes my world a lighter place.

&nbsp;

<strong>Time with Lick</strong>:  9 months

&nbsp;

<strong>Why I love ice cream</strong>:  Ice cream makes everyone happy!

&nbsp;

<strong>Favorite flavor</strong>:  Blushing Blueberry.... Oh how I can't wait for its return.  A couple weeks ago, our kitchen manager, Diana, found some forgotten pints of it in the freezer and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven with a spoon.  Two scoops!

        "post_content": "<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>Get Honest Answers About Honest Ice Creams</h2>
<h3>Is your ice cream organic?</h3>
No. Although we use as many organic ingredients as possible, not everything we use is certified organic; and, therefore we cannot label Lick ice creams as “organic.” Since we cannot source everything organic, we make every effort to get our ingredients from sustainable farmers and responsible artisans; luckily, in Austin, Texas, they’re not too hard to find!
<h3>Are your products gluten-free?</h3>
Yes. Our ice creams are gluten-free. If there are ever any exceptions to this, we will certainly make it known to our customers. Our homemade ice cream cones are NOT gluten-free.
<h3>Are your waffle cones homemade?</h3>
Yes. We make our cone mix from scratch and roll each one by hand in our South Austin shop. Our cones contain local organic eggs and are NOT gluten-free.
<h3>Where do you make your ice cream?</h3>
We make every single batch by hand at our production kitchen in Northwest Austin.  Each flavor is created in 2½ gallon batches and either sent by the tub to our South Lamar shop or packed by hand into pint containers and distributed to our many wholesale customers in the Austin area.
<h3>Are all of your ingredients locally sourced?</h3>
Locavorism is very important to Lick Ice Creams, and we source locally every chance we get. Unfortunately, ingredients like vanilla, cocoa, coconut milk, and a handful of others do not yet grow in Texas. If ingredients are not available to be locally sourced, we make it a point to acquire them from small, locally-owned businesses wherever possible.
